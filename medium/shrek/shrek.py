# In the file script.txt, contains the entire script for the movie Shrek. I have hidden some characters demarking the characters of the flag.

# for example, if i used '_' to demark the flag, 
# the script would look something like:
# 
# -That's w_h_at they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on 
# 
# your back. Dead.
# 
# -You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to s_i_t down?

# which spells out: 'hi'
# which means the flag is 'CTFInfocomm{hi}'


# To make your life hard, the demarkator is a character of ascii value 8203

# Hint: you'll need to download the file and read it in a utf-8 encoding
