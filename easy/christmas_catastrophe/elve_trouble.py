# Okay I know it's not Christmas at the time of you solving it, but these puzzles were made before the date of the CTF was fixed
# So cut me some slack okay

# Christmas disaster has struck!
# The Elves helping Santa out has a little trouble with their accounting
# 
# They just need you to fix your expense report, apparently, something isn't quite adding up.
# 
# Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2021 and then multiply those two numbers together.
# 
# For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
# 
# 1722
# 979
# 366
# 299
# 675
# 1456
# In this list, the two entries that sum to 2021 are 1722 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1722 * 299 = 514878, so the correct answer is 514878.
# 
# (And the flag is CTFInfocomm{514878})
# 
# Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2021; what do you get if you multiply them together?
